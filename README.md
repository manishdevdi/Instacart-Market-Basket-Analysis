# Instacart-Market-Basket-Analysis

## Introduction
Instacart is an American technology company that operates as a same-day grocery delivery and pick up service in the U.S. and Canada. Customers shop for groceries through the Instacart mobile app or Instacart.com from various retailer partners. The order is shopped and delivered by an Instacart personal shopper.

## Objectives:
- Analyze the anonymized data of 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users open sourced by Instacart
- Find out hidden association between products for better cross-selling and upselling
- Perform customer segmentation for targeted marketing and anticipate customer behavior
- Build a Machine Learning model to predict which previously purchased product will be in user’s next order
